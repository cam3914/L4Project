# Project meetings

## 8th October

* Discussed project options
* Sent a few paper and things to research

## 18th October

* Confirmed Project title
* Meeting format (slides, questions, etc)
* Went through student/supervisor questionnaire 
* Mentieoned different technologies (Pytorch/Keras), no preference
* Emphasis on uncertainty of predictions
* Might be able to do transfer learning from google brain paper code
* Cost function by distance in space of spectra
* Ideally trace predictions back to SMILES string
* Discussed data source
* Possibility of coordination with other projects, not until later on

## 25th October

* Update on progress
* Confirmed GitHub VCS
* Confirmed data formatting in (.mgf) but only need SMILES
* Discussed semester plan (optimistic) for week 6-12
* Early steps: predict presence of spectra accurately first

## 1st November

* Data transfer
* RMT research overlap, choose ML in metabolomics/MS to deepen understanding, be careful not to overlap too much
* Research Sirius 4 paper and it's citations - best results (metfrag) 
* CFM-ID and google brain paper are to only two methods of prediction so far
* Sirius/CSI:FingerID wininng CASMI
* Once read in and formatted data, need to bin spectra (integers?)
* Next meeting on Friday at 1.30pm
* Sent link to github repository
